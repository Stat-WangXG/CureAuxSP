# CureAuxSP
This is an R package used to fit cure models with auxiliary survival Information.

Still in editing and please wait patiently ... Thank you!

### Available models (Current and Future)

We main focus on cure models, including:
- Mixture cure model
- Promotion time cure model (to appear)

### Key techniques for our methods

### Introduction to main functions
- **SMC.AuxSP.AIS**: fit the semiparametric mixture cure model with homogeneous auxiliary subgroup survival rates using AIS
- **SMC.AuxSP.PAIS**: fit the semiparametric mixture cure model using with heterogeneous auxiliary subgroup survival rates using PAIS
