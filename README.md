# CureAuxSP
This is an R package used to fit cure models with auxiliary survival Information.
The underlying methods are based on the paper titled "Efficient auxiliary information synthesis for cure rate model", which has been accepted by JRSSC with DOI: 10.1093/jrsssc/qlad106.

Still in editing and please wait patiently ... Thank you!

### Available models (Current and Future)

We main focus on cure models, including:
- Mixture cure model
- Promotion time cure model (to appear)

### Key techniques for our methods

### Introduction to main functions
- **SMC.AuxSP.AIS**: fit the semiparametric mixture cure model with homogeneous auxiliary subgroup survival rates using AIS
- **SMC.AuxSP.PAIS**: fit the semiparametric mixture cure model using with heterogeneous auxiliary subgroup survival rates using PAIS
